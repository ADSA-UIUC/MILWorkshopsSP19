This is the first workshop in the MIL Python applications series during Spring 2019.

This workshop is being put on by the [Association of Data Science and Analytics](https://www.facebook.com/adsauiuc/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in partnership with the [MIL @ the Gies College of Business](https://giesgroups.illinois.edu/marketlab/home/).

The goal of this workshop is to introduce the ABC's of Python, and an example of how it can be leveraged in real-world applications.

The outline of the workshop is as follows:
> Introduce basic Python syntax in the intro_python_variables.ipynb notebook
> Introduce basic Python data structures and conditionals in the intro_python_structures.ipynb notebook
> Introduce functions and demonstrate a real-world application in the intro_python_applications.ipynb notebook

You will need [Python and Anaconda installed](https://medium.com/@jlroo/python-for-business-tutorial-8801c868db10) on your machine to partake in this workshop. If you are working on a MIL computer, these are already installed for you.
